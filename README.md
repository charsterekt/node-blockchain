# A simple Proof of Stake blockchain
<br>

Implemented in Node.js, this blockchain is a very simple but functional model that consists of a few different parts. An Express.js API to interact with the blockchain and simulate transactions, a peer to peer server using WebSockets to be able to connect each peer on the blockchain to each other, and an Express.js API specifically for the ICO (initial coin offering) as this blockchain uses Proof-of-Stake consensus, which requires an ICO. It has been implemented using an object oriented approach. Additional libraries required for development are `crypto-js`, `uuid@3.x`, `body-parser`, `ws` (websockets), `elliptic`. <br>
